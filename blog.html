    <h2>Difference Between Local Storage, Session Storage</h2>
    <p> Answer :
        Local Storage: This read-only interface property provides access to the Document’s local storage object, the
        stored data is stored across browser sessions. Similar to sessionStorage, except that localStorage data gets
        cleared when the page session ends – that is when the page is closed. It is cleared when the last “private” tab
        of a browser is closed (localStorage data for a document loaded in a private browsing or incognito session).
        Session Storage :Session Storage objects can be accessed using the sessionStorage read-only property. The
        difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas
        sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends.

        A unique page session gets created once a document is loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions are valid for only
        one tab at a time.

    <h2>Difference between Block scope and Global scope in Javascript? </h2>
    <p>Global Scope
        The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have global
        scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any function or
        conditional state can access that variable.
        Block Scope
        Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the variables
        inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or something
        else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.

    </p>
    <h2>How does Event loop Work</h2>
    <p>The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty,
        the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively
        runs it.

        Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop. Each event is just a function callback.</p>

    <h2></h2>
    <p>
        JavaScript uses the undefined value in the following situations.

        1) Accessing an uninitialized variable
        When you declare a variable and don’t initialize it to a value, the variable will have a value of undefined.
        2) Accessing a non-existing property of an object
        If you access a non-existing property of an object, you’ll get undefined.
        3) Function parameters
        When you call a function with a number of parameters, you often pass the same number of arguments.
        4) Functions return a value
        A function that doesn’t have a return statement implicitly returns undefined.
        5) Accessing out-of-bounds array elements
        When you access an array element that is out-of-bounds, you’ll get the undefined value.
